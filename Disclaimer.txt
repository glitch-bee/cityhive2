# Welcome to City Hive üêù

## What is City Hive?

City Hive is a community-powered mapping tool that helps track feral honey bee colonies‚Äîwild hives that live in tree cavities, walls, and other hidden spots across our urban landscape. These aren't the managed hives you might see in a beekeeper's apiary. Feral colonies form on their own, often after a swarm splits off from an existing hive. They represent a critical but largely undocumented part of the urban ecosystem.

City Hive is designed to make this hidden world visible.

## Why This Matters

- Feral hives may be more genetically diverse or more adapted to local environments than managed colonies
- They play a crucial role in pollination, often in places where managed hives aren't present
- Understanding where and how they survive helps support bee conservation, swarm management, and even public safety

## Getting Started

### How to Use City Hive

Using just a smartphone, anyone can add a sighting to our live map‚Äîtagging locations of wild hives, active swarms, or structures where bees are living. Each marker supports photos, detailed notes, and collaborative comments, making it easy to share what you see and learn from others. All updates appear in real time, so the tool is equally useful for fieldwork, research, or even casual urban exploration.

### Current Features

City Hive is already live and in use. You can:
- View and add sightings
- Upload photos
- Track colony activity over time
- Use our mobile-friendly interface
- Get instant updates across all users
- Make detailed observations through our touch-friendly interface

## Looking Ahead

We're working on:
- Real-time swarm alerts for emergency response and community coordination
- Research tools to link colonies with local flora and environmental data
- Educational outreach and partnerships with schools, parks, and conservation groups
- Long-term data collection to better understand bee health and urban biodiversity

## Join Our Community

City Hive is a tool for beekeepers‚Äîbut also for researchers, naturalists, city planners, and anyone who cares about the health of urban ecosystems. By helping map and monitor wild bees in New York and beyond, we're building a clearer picture of pollinator life in the city‚Äîand a stronger foundation for protecting it.
