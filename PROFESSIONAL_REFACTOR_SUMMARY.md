  - **Surface Primary** (#fafbfa): Very light sage instead of bright white
- **Eliminated Harsh White**: Replaced all stark white backgrounds with warm, muted alternatives
- Updated CSS custom properties for scientific/research aesthetic
- Removed decorative gradients in favor of solid, earthy colors
- Creates a professional, field-research atmosphere with reduced eye strain

### 2. Typography & Spacing
- More precise spacing scale for data-dense interfaces
- Professional font stack with system fonts
- Improved readability with better contrast ratios
- Reduced animation durations for professional feel

### 3. Branding & Naming
- **App Name**: "NYC Feral Bee Survey"
- **Navigation**: "Map" â†’ "Survey Map", "About" â†’ "Data Analysis"
