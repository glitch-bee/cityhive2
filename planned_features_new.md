## ðŸŽ¯ Project Vision & Target Users

### **For Beekeepers**
CityHive2 serves as a comprehensive tool for professional and hobbyist beekeepers to:

- **Monitor swarm activity** in their operational area for capture opportunities
- **Track removal sites** for cut-out services and structural bee removal
- **Share verified hive locations** with the beekeeping community
- **Receive notifications** about nearby swarms or bee-inhabited structures (opt-in)
- **Document successful captures** and removal outcomes for future reference

### **For Citizen Scientists & Researchers**
The platform enables comprehensive data collection for bee research and conservation:

- **Document feral bee colonies** and wild hive populations
- **Track bee behavior patterns** including activity levels and seasonal changes  
- **Record environmental data** such as tree species preferences and nesting site characteristics
- **Monitor colony health indicators** including aggression levels, varroa mite presence, and colony origins
- **Contribute to urban bee research** through standardized data collection
- **Build long-term datasets** for population trend analysis and conservation planning

### **For Community Collaboration**
CityHive2 facilitates knowledge sharing and collective bee stewardship:

- **Real-time sighting alerts** for time-sensitive swarm captures
- **Collaborative documentation** through community comments and observations
- **Data sharing** for research institutions and conservation organizations
- **Educational outreach** about urban bee populations and conservation
